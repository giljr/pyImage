## OPEN CV + Jupyter Notebook Archieve

Hi, this is all about [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), easy like Python itself!

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, 
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

OpenCV + Python is Really Amazing!

In this repository I will offer all my files while I learn OpenCV from scratch through self-study, mainly using Jupyter Notebook :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

```
What is Python OpenCV? 

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python 
bindings designed to solve 
computer vision problems. 

Is OpenCV a framework?

Yes, 
is a computer vision framework 
that helps you do all sorts of 
processing on images and videos. 
Since its release, it's been 
a widely used tool for 
image processing tasks.

it's just amazing!
