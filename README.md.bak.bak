## Jupyter Notebook Fun Factory Archieve

Hi, this is all about [Python](https://www.python.org/), easy like Python itself!

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

In this repository I will offer all my files while I learn Python from scratch through self-study, mainly using VSCode Editor with Jupiter Notebook :notebook_with_decorative_cover:

```
Why Jupyter?

Jupyter is a free,
open-source,
interactive web tool
known as a computational notebook,
which researchers can use to combine
software code, computational output,
explanatory text and multimedia resources
in a single document.
it's just amazing!
```
